# Application Name: Team Profile Generator


## Description

Welcome to the Team Profile Generator! As the leader of an organization, whether it is a business or a non-profit, it is handy to be able to keep track of your team's basic information in one place and then display it to the world (it could come in handy for potential investors or donors). However, while compiling your team's information may be simple enough, it is not always easy to take that information and organize it visually on a webpage.

Luckily, the Team Profile Generator can help! This application, in conjunction with Node and Inquirer, will allow you to quickly enter your team's information straight in your CLI, one member at a time. Once you finish, your entire team profile will be complete and ready to render.

This application should be ready to go right from download. You may need to do an 'npm install' command with the package.json file in your CLI to ensure that Inquirer and all necessary packages are installed. When you're ready to create your team profiles, simply open up the application in your integrated terminal, and enter 'node index.js' to start the application. Continue entering information until you are done with your team, and once you finish, all the profiles will be automatically populated in the HTML section of the application, thus allowing you to visually display your finished team profiles in an aesthetic, web-page format!
